## Airbnb Clone Backend: Features and Functionalities

This document outlines the detailed features and functionalities required for the backend of an Airbnb Clone application, as per the provided project requirements. The backend will handle server-side logic, database management, and API integrations to support a scalable, secure, and robust system.

---

### Core Functionalities

The core functionalities of the backend will enable the essential features of a rental marketplace.

#### 1. User Management

* **User Registration:**
    * Allow users to sign up as either **guests** or **hosts**.
    * Utilize **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure authentication.
* **User Login and Authentication:**
    * Support login via email and password.
    * Include **OAuth** options (e.g., Google, Facebook) for convenient sign-in.
* **Profile Management:**
    * Enable users to update their profiles, including profile photos, contact information, and preferences.

#### 2. Property Listings Management

* **Add Listings:**
    * Hosts can create new property listings, providing details such as title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability.
* **Edit/Delete Listings:**
    * Hosts can update or remove their existing property listings.

#### 3. Search and Filtering

* Implement comprehensive search functionality, allowing users to find properties based on:
    * **Location**
    * **Price range**
    * **Number of guests**
    * **Amenities** (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly).
* Include **pagination** for efficient handling of large datasets in search results.

#### 4. Booking Management

* **Booking Creation:**
    * Guests can book a property for specified dates.
    * Implement **date validation** to prevent double bookings.
* **Booking Cancellation:**
    * Allow guests or hosts to cancel bookings based on defined cancellation policies.
* **Booking Status:**
    * Track booking statuses, including pending, confirmed, canceled, or completed.

#### 5. Payment Integration

* Implement secure payment gateways (e.g., **Stripe, PayPal**) to manage:
    * **Upfront payments** by guests.
    * **Automatic payouts** to hosts after a booking is completed.
* Support **multiple currencies**.

#### 6. Reviews and Ratings

* Guests can leave **reviews and ratings** for properties they have stayed in.
* Hosts can **respond to reviews**.
* Ensure reviews are linked to specific bookings to maintain integrity and prevent abuse.

#### 7. Notifications System

* Implement an email and in-app notifications system for:
    * **Booking confirmations**
    * **Cancellations**
    * **Payment updates**

#### 8. Admin Dashboard

* Create an administrator interface for monitoring and managing:
    * **Users**
    * **Listings**
    * **Bookings**
    * **Payments**

### Technical Requirements

These requirements specify the technological foundations and architectural considerations for the backend.

#### 1. Database Management

* Use a relational database such as **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**.
* Required tables:
    * **Users** (distinguishing between guests and hosts)
    * **Properties**
    * **Bookings**
    * **Reviews**
    * **Payments**

#### 2. API Development

* Utilize **RESTful APIs** to expose backend functionalities to the frontend.
* Adhere to proper HTTP methods and status codes for:
    * **GET** (retrieve data)
    * **POST** (create data)
    * **PUT/PATCH** (update data)
    * **DELETE** (remove data)
* **GraphQL** is optionally recommended for complex data fetching scenarios.

#### 3. Authentication and Authorization

* Employ **JWT** for secure user sessions.
* Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)** to differentiate permissions among:
    * **Guests**
    * **Hosts**
    * **Admins**

#### 4. File Storage

* Store property images and user profile photos in cloud storage solutions like **AWS S3** or **Cloudinary**.

#### 5. Third-Party Services

* Integrate email services such as **SendGrid** or **Mailgun** for email notifications.

#### 6. Error Handling and Logging

* Implement **global error handling** for all APIs.
* Establish a robust **logging system** for monitoring and debugging.

### Non-Functional Requirements

These requirements focus on the quality attributes of the system, ensuring its robustness and efficiency.

#### 1. Scalability

* Design a **modular architecture** to facilitate easy scaling as user traffic increases.
* Enable **horizontal scaling** using load balancers.

#### 2. Security

* Secure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) using **encryption**.
* Implement **firewalls and rate limiting** to prevent malicious activities.

#### 3. Performance Optimization

* Utilize **caching tools** like **Redis** to improve response times for frequently accessed data (e.g., search results).
* Optimize **database queries** to reduce server load and enhance performance.

#### 4. Testing

* Implement **unit and integration tests** using frameworks like **pytest**.
* Include **automated API testing** to ensure all endpoints function as expected.
